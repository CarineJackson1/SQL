    SUM(o.order_total) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    AVG(o.order_total) as avg_order_value,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(o.order_total) DESC) as revenue_rank
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
