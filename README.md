## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By exploring these queries, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ How to write **readable, maintainable SQL** at scale
- ‚úÖ **Performance considerations** when working with large datasets
- ‚úÖ **Database design principles** (normalization, relationships)
- ‚úÖ **Real-world problems** solved with SQL
- ‚úÖ **ETL workflows** and data pipeline logic

## üîó How to Use These Queries

### 1. **Study the Code**
Each query is commented and explained. Start with simpler queries in `/queries/complex_joins/` and progress to advanced concepts.

### 2. **Adapt to Your Database**
- These examples work with PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Adjust syntax as needed for your specific database system
- See `/schemas/` for database setup instructions

### 3. **Test & Optimize**
- Run queries on your own datasets
- Analyze execution plans (EXPLAIN in PostgreSQL)
- Implement suggested optimizations

### 4. **Reuse in Projects**
- These patterns are production-ready
- Use as templates for your own analysis
- Modify for your specific data structure

## üìö Query Examples at a Glance

### Advanced JOINs
```sql
-- Query to find customers who made purchases in multiple categories
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT oc.category_id) as category_count
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN categories oc ON p.category_id = oc.category_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT oc.category_id) > 1
ORDER BY category_count DESC;
```

### Window Functions
```sql
-- Query to show customer rank by total spending
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    total_spent,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) as spending_rank,
    LAG(total_spent) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) as prev_customer_spent
FROM customer_spending
ORDER BY spending_rank;
```

### Performance Optimization
See `/queries/optimization/` for execution plans and indexing strategies.
